Provide a re-usable open source version of an Randomizer Framework, meant to be used as a "code library" referenced from other projects.
Requirements
Generic requirements
Library should be easy to use, compile and contribute to
Easy to reference and use from other projects
Library should conform to Design Guidelines, Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns normally used in the eco system
Version 1.0 - The Basics
Provide a basic re-usable "code library" that provides the following capabilities:
Random word - Given a string, method should return a random word within.
Shuffel - Given a list of T, method should return a shuffeled list of T
Version 1.1 - The Basics, Update 1
Introduce additional features:
Almost True - Create a method that returns true P % of the time, otherwise false
Predictable Random - If not yet implemented make sure all methods have a way of returning a predictable random behaviour.
Version 2.0 - Complexity
Introduce additional features:
Noise - Create a method that creates and outputs "noise" to a stream
Simulated Error - Create a method that given a string, sometimes, returns a slightly changed string. How often the string is messed up should be set by a parameter.
Version 2.1 - Complexity, Update 1
Introduce a way to "subscribe" to Simulated Errors, so you can act if it happens (for example log, set break points, etc.)
Version 2.2 - Complexity, Update 2
Provide a way to set the "Almost True" and "Simulated Error" rate in a configuration file.
Version 3.0 - Additional Features
Create a method that returns a random integer up to a specific number, but never the same number twice, even if process is reset.
Introduce the ability to reset the ability to return the same value
