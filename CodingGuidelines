# To create additional feature in this solution we work with the following branches:

1. Development
2. Test
3 Master

You can create additional features by adding them to the development branch and then commit them. Then when all development is done and everything is
committed your code will be reviewed. If it adheres to coding standards, changes will be committed to test and when tested throroughly, the features will go
to production. So only work in the development branch and never commit to master.
